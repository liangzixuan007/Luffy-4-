  TODO: Create a motivational post website.
Style it how ever you like. 
Look at the goal image for inspiration.
But it must have the following features:
1. The main h1 text should be using the Regular Libre Baskerville Font from Google Fonts:
  https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Libre+Baskerville
2. The text should be white and background black.
3. Add your own image into the images folder inside assets. It should have a 5px white border.
4. The text should be center aligned.
5. Create a div to contain the h1, p and img elements. Adjust the margins so that the image and text are centered on the page. 
  Hint: You horizontally center a div by giving it a width of 50% and a margin-left of 25%.
  Hint: Set the image to have a width of 100% so it fills the div. 
6. Read about the text-transform property on MDN docs to make the h1 uppercase with CSS.

    <img class="motivation-img" src="./assets/images/LuffyGear2.png" src="daenerys with egg" />
    <h1>Luffy Gear 2</h1>
    <p>Gear 2 is achieved by Luffy stretching and manipulating his blood vessels to speed up the blood flow in his body, resulting in a red glow, increased body temperature, faster metabolism, and, most importantly, a stark increase in power</p>

  <div class="poster">
    <img class="motivation-img" src="./assets/images/LuffyGear3.png" src="daenerys with egg" />
    <h1>Luffy Gear 3</h1>
    <p>Gear 3 consists of Luffy biting into his thumb and blowing air into his bones (ew) to inflate his fist to sizes as big or bigger than giants' hands. This is a technique Luffy breaks out when he needs raw strength, with his inflated fists able to deal insane damage, though they are quite slow-moving</p>

    <img class="motivation-img" src="./assets/images/LuffyGear4.png" src="daenerys with egg" />
    <h1>Luffy Gear 4</h1>
    <p>Gear 4 ("Gear Fourth") is a transformation technique that uses the power of the Gomu Gomu no Mi and Busoshoku Haki. It has multiple variations that enhance some amount of the user's defense, speed, and power beyond their normal limits. It was first seen in Luffy's battle against Donquixote Doflamingo.</p>

  <div class="poster">
    <img class="motivation-img" src="./assets/images/LuffyGear5.png" src="daenerys with egg" />
    <h1>Luffy Gear 5</h1>
    <p>Gear 5 ("Gear Fifth") is the awakened form of the Hito Hito no Mi, Model: Nika, which strengthens the user's rubbery body. It also allows the user the ability to manipulate and transform their environment, similar to a Paramecia's awakening. Luffy achieved this ability during his final battle with Kaidou on Onigashima.</p>
